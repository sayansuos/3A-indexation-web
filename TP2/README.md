# TP2 Index Implementation

## Goal

Creating different index types using an e-commerce database on products. 

## Executing the code

To execute the code, first set up a virtual environment (optional but recommanded) and install dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To produce the different results, either manually run the notebook in ``TP2/TP2.ipynb`` or the associated python file with:

```bash
python -m TP2.TP2
```
